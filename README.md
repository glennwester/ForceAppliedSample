ForceAppliedSample
=====

ForceApplied is a simple Xamarin.iOS sample to demonstrate 3D touch.

ForceApplied supports iOS9.
It will check to make sure that the device is 3D-Touch enabled (iPhone 6S/6Splus) and change the opacity of the UIVew with the amount of force applied (Kylo Ren please don't download this).
